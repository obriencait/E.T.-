        <h2>Welcome to My E.T. Toy Collection</h2>
        <p>As a child of the 90s, E.T. The Extraterrestrial was more than just a movie to me—it was a friend. I grew up watching E.T. over and over again, and I even cried the first time I watched it because I loved E.T. so much. I thought he was going to die!</p>
        <p>Today, I carry that love for E.T. with me, and it’s a part of my life that I cherish deeply. When I gave birth to my son, I named him Elliott after my childhood hero. E.T. and Elliott have been a huge part of our lives, and this website is dedicated to both of them!</p>

        <h2>About E.T. The Extraterrestrial</h2>
        <p>E.T. is one of the most beloved characters from the 1982 film directed by Steven Spielberg. The story of E.T., a kind and gentle alien stranded on Earth, and his friendship with a young boy named Elliott, captured the hearts of audiences worldwide. Over the years, E.T. became an iconic symbol of love, friendship, and family.</p>
        <p>My E.T. toy was my constant companion during my childhood, and it’s something I’ve cherished since the first time I got it. My son and I continue to collect E.T. toys and memorabilia, celebrating the magic of this film and the special connection it gave me with my childhood best friend, E.T.</p>
